Conington coin data – key fields and terminology

SITECODE
- Unique code for the excavation area within the A14 project (for example A14-32 or A14-33).
- Targeted excavation area (TEA) the coin comes from.

CONTEXT
- Number of the archaeological context (layer, pit fill, feature) where the coin was found.
- Used to link coins to stratigraphy and settlement phases.

PERIOD
- Broad period of the context in the excavation database (for example 99 may mean “unphased” or “all periods” in this register).
- This is dating based on stratigraphy/feature, not on the coin itself.

MATERIAL
- Metal of the object, such as COPPER ALLOY, SILVER, or LEAD.
- Important for distinguishing coins from tokens and for later conservation/interpretation.

COIN_TYPE
- General object class as identified by the specialist, such as COIN, COPY (imitation), or JETTON (token-like piece).
- Helps separate ‘proper’ coins from copies and jettons.

COIN_REGIME
- High-level historical regime/period of the coin based on numismatic identification.
- Codes used here:
  - IA = Iron Age
  - R  = Roman
  - AS = Anglo-Saxon
  - E  = Medieval
  - N  = Post-medieval
- This is coin-based dating, independent of the context’s stratigraphic period.

RULER
- Short code for the authority who issued the coin (emperor or monarch), for example:
  - CONSTANTIUS II, VALENTINIAN I (Roman emperors)
  - JAM1 (James I)
- Narrowly constrains the date range of the coin.

COIN_EDATE / COIN_LDATE
- ‘Early date’ and ‘late date’ for the coin in calendar years.
- Together they give the interpreted date range during which the coin could have been struck.
  - Example: 364–365 for a late Roman nummus of Valentinian I.
  - Example: 1066–1485 for a broadly dated medieval penny.
- In cleaning, 0 or negative years are treated as “unknown”.

DENOMINATION
- Named value/type of the coin when known, e.g. NUMMUS, SESTERTIUS, PENNY, TOKEN.
- Often linked to size, weight and metal.

DIAMETER
- Maximum diameter of the coin in millimetres.
- Useful as a numeric feature; larger denominations are usually physically bigger.

MINT
- City or mint where the coin was struck when identifiable, e.g. TRIER, ARLES, LYON.
- Adds geographic context to the issue, but is often missing or uncertain.

COIN_CONDITION
- Short description of the preservation state, e.g. WORN, CORR (corroded), FRAG (fragmentary).
- Relevant for taphonomy and sometimes for deciding whether measurements are reliable.

Derived features (created in the notebooks)

mid_date
- Simple average of COIN_EDATE and COIN_LDATE.
- Gives a single central year for the coin’s interpreted date range.
- Used as a numeric feature for plots, clustering, and classification.

date_span
- COIN_LDATE minus COIN_EDATE.
- Measures how wide the dating range is.
  - Small span = precisely dated issue.
  - Large span = very broad or uncertain dating.

How to “read” a row

Each row represents one coin or related object, with:
- Provenance: SITECODE + CONTEXT.
- Context-based dating: PERIOD.
- Coin-based dating: COIN_REGIME, RULER, COIN_EDATE/COIN_LDATE, mid_date, date_span.
- Physical/typological info: MATERIAL, COIN_TYPE, DENOMINATION, DIAMETER, MINT, COIN_CONDITION.

In later analysis, you can compare:
- Context dating (PERIOD) vs coin dating (COIN_REGIME, mid_date).
- Chronology vs physical size (mid_date vs DIAMETER).
- Differences between regimes (R vs AS vs E vs N) using these shared fields.
